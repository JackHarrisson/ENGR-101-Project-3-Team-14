Q1 test
Testing for the core of the project

We have two versions of the core project currently uploaded to the Github, by both Jamie and Alek, 
Jamie's code is about 83 lines long and is contained within the robot.cpp file, it works by
checking how many non white pixels should be on each side of the white line, and adjusts its movement  to compensate.
Jamie's code is able to complete the core part of the maze, although is slow and jittery, and increasing the
speed only makes it swerve more.

Alek’s code is split up into multiple parts, as he has split the code up into his main robot.cpp and 2 hpp files, 
RobotMovement.hpp and RobotView.hpp. The RobotView.hpp gets the pixels that the robot sees, and the RobotMovement.hpp moves the robot.
Alek’s code seems to be far more accurate than Jamie and the robot is able to move faster without swerving all over the white line 

Both Jamie and Aleks Robots were able to make it to the finish line making the Q1 tests a success


Q2 test
Alek has uploaded multiple files for the completion portion of the project, he has uploaded
a “robot.cpp”,”RobotMovement.hpp”,”RobotView.hpp”, and 
“ main_completion.cpp” but I have not been able to get the main_completion.cpp file to work, 
I keep getting an error stating “ “./main_completion” ‘ is not recognized as an internal or 
external command, operable program or batch file.” ( this problem was solved by renaming the file to robot.cpp 
and disregarding the other robot.cpp file)

Running the code on the completion track the robot seems to move in 
fairly straight lines and snaps to different angles when it comes to a 
corner, but when it gets to the end of the track, turns off the white line 
and moves towards the bottom-right hand side of the screen



So far the completion portion of the project is unsuccessful and we are working on fixing it up,
I have also sent in an email to ask whether it is ok for the robot to be snapping in the direction it wants to go.

I have tested the completion portion of the project and it is currently working as intended,
the robot is able to make it all the way through the maze without stopping or deviating from the white line 
this makes the q2 test a success.

Q3 test
The challenge portion of the code has been completed and works by allowing the robot to follow 
the left hand side of the red maze, so this time instead of following a white line the robot is trying 
to navigate through a maze made out of red lines, which the robot cannot move through,

Running the code, the robot is able to move through the full maze and make it to the 
flag without breaking and does so at an acceptable speed, making the Q3 test a success.
